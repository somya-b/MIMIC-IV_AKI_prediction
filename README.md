## Predicting Acute Kidney Injury in ICU patients: a data-driven modelling approach


The codes were used to predict acute kidney injury in ICU paitents aged>=18 years. 
AdaBoosting and Gradient Boosting showed best performace in predicting whether a patient admitted in ICU develops AKI or not. 

AdaBoost (test set): f1-score = 0.7909, accuracy = 0.7053
Gradient Boost (test set): f1-score = 0.7854, accuracy = 0.7003

AdaBoost (test set): f1-score = 0.7815, accuracy = 0.6953
Gradient Boost (validation set): f1-score = 0.7888, accuracy = 0.7082
